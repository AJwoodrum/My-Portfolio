<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I went to Cascade high school and started work at an early age, my first real job was at a gourmet dogfood factory at the age of fourteen. Three years later I found a new line of work at a lumber mill called 'Freres'. There I spent a long and physically taxing five years doing six eight hour days, and with plenty of close calls. However after a disagreement with management I decided it best to leave and find a less dangerous job. I then started working for <em>Coca-Cola</em> for three years.</p>
    <p>Luckily from my experience at Freres the physical labor was no issue whatsoever. However the hours were unpredictable and fellow coworkers were not great teamplayers. Once the Covid-19 pandemic hit I decided it best to stay home rather than risk the virus from my distributing job, a decision my employers didn't share and considered it volountary leave rather than termination. It was then I decided if physical labor, mental stress and no time with my family was what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life... That was when I heard of <em>Epicodus</em>!</p>
    <p>I was both nervous and excited all at the same time, I always wanted to program but haven't even touched a computer for well over a decade. As soon as I started my classes I was pleasantly surprised by the <strong>NON</strong>-hostile enviroment and fantastic chemistry between my instructors and fellow students! It can be a bit complicated at times but I've always prided myself on my endurableness, and I feel that I'm catching on to the lessons fairly well. I'm <strong>VERY</strong> excited to learn more into coding and am looking forward to what the future holds.</p>
    
    <h2>More Abut Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I love to play video games</li>
        <li>I also like board games</li>
        <li>I like watching movies and shows</li>
        <li>I enjoy reading in my spare time</li>
        <li>I like painting (Mostly good with figurines)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I had to list my skills I'd say I'm a good team player, I can be intuitive and I'm very patient. I'm also pretty strong which will most likely not be used for prgramming.</p>
